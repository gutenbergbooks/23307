<p><span class="smcap">Paulina Evering</span> was an intelligent
girl, and as interesting
as she was intelligent and pretty.
She was kind-hearted, and
generous almost to a fault. She
was beloved by all the children
in her neighborhood; for she
was ever indulging them in
some way. She had a beautiful
grape-vine in the garden
nurtured by her own hand.
And when the grapes were ripe,
she seldom tasted of them herself,
but when any little boys
or girls called to see her, she
would ask the servant to go
into the garden, and give them
bountifully of the luscious fruit.</p>

<p>She was noted for her humanity
to the brute creation.
She looked upon everything
that drew breath as the handiwork
of that Being to which
she owed her own existence;
and though she had seen scarce
twelve summers, she was old
enough to feel that by the exercise
of kindness to dumb
beasts even, she could evince
her gratitude for life, health,
and other blessings she enjoyed.</p>

<p>Paulina went one day, to
spend a few hours with her
cousins; as she reached the
door, they were just driving
from the house a poor dog,
which had once been such a
favorite with them, that they
fed it on the greatest delicacies,
and never would let it sleep
but on a nice cushion.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo006.jpg"><img src="images/illo006_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do
with poor Fido?&#8221; cried Paulina.
&#8220;Oh! the vile animal!&#8221; said
her cousin Emily. &#8220;Look how
frightful he has grown! I
would not let him stay in the
house for the world; I am going
to give him to those boys
at the door: and I do not care
what they do with him, for my
brother Charles has given me
a little beauty. Come in, and
I will show him to you.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Stop,
do stay a moment,&#8221; said
Paulina; &#8220;I beg you will not
give Fido to those wicked boys
they will torment him to death.
It was but the other day, some
wicked boys fastened a tin-pot
to a poor dog's tail, and then
let him run, with it dragging
after him, frightening the poor
creature almost to death. I
beg of you, do not let the hard-hearted
fellows have him. Give
him to me, and I will take him
to my little hospital, and nurse
him as long as he lives.&#8221; Fido
had gone into the kitchen
(where young ladies and dogs
have certainly nothing to do),
and the cook, who was very
busy, preparing for a great dinner,
had thrown some boiling
water over his head and back,
and scalded him in such a dreadful
manner, that no one thought
he could live through the day.
Emily was so much enraged
with the cook, and shed so
many tears when she saw her
pet suffering so much, that every
one thought she had an
excellent heart, and was really
attached to her dog; but as
soon as he was cured, and she
found he had lost an eye, and
had no hair on his back, she
could not bear the sight of him.
Fido was beaten out of the hall,
obliged to look for bones, and
sleep in a corner, on the stairs;
and at last, if Paulina had not
come in time to save him, he
would have been given up to
half a dozen wicked boys, who
would have tormented him to
death. Paulina was much displeased
with her cousin from
this circumstance, for her character
was very different from
Emily's. The little hospital
she had alluded to was for her
sick or lame animals. It was
composed of a dog, whose paw
had been broken; a cat, whose
ear had been bitten off, by a
great rat which it had caught,
and a blind squirrel. Beside
these, she had in a cage a little
sparrow, whose wings had been
broken by a bird of prey; and
as it could not fly to the bottom
of its cage for water, or
food, she made a little ladder
for it, so it could jump up and
down when it pleased. She
had besides a thrush, which had
been almost frozen to death,
and never recovered the use of
its feet: but it did not sing the
less gayly, though a cripple.

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo010.jpg"><img src="images/illo010_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>She had also a pet rabbit,
which she had saved from the
torments of two cruel boys,
who had caught it, and whom
she overheard relating what
sport they would have, when
they got home, by letting it
loose in the stable, and then
setting the dog on to worry it
to death. The little creature
had become so tame, that it
would run to her whenever she
came to the place where it was
kept, and when she took it up,
would nestle itself in her arms
to show its gratitude for her
kind treatment and tender care
of it. She had, besides, several
fowls and ducks, that lived
very comfortably in her yard,
because she took care of them
herself and did not trust it to
any one else.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo011.jpg"><img src="images/illo011_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>And last, not by any means
least, among her favorites, was
a beautiful young deer, which
her father had purchased, and
brought home to her.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo013.jpg"><img src="images/illo013_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Paulina felt the greatest
pleasure in giving these pet
animals all the comforts she
could, and her father and mother,
to encourage her benevolent
disposition, increased her
pocket-money, that she might
be enabled to buy corn for her
fowls, and seeds for her birds.
Her brothers, too, who were at
college, often sent her presents.</p>

<p>One day when Paulina was
out, her attention was called
to a young woman who had
brought two young lambs to
market for sale. The two
creatures were coupled together
like hounds; and as she
stood with her eyes cast down,
yet looking upon them, it was
impossible not to note the sorrow
stamped upon her gentle
features. Paulina was interested
and entered into conversation
with her. She learned
that she was a young married
woman; that her husband had
gone to sea; leaving his mother,
a very infirm old woman to
her care. Soon after his departure,
Mary left her father's
more comfortable dwelling to
reside in the old woman's cabin,
so that she could take the better
care of her. A sheep was
her only fortune and she took
it with her. It had two lambs,
and these she hoped to be able
to keep toward the formation
of a mountain flock; but the
season was so pinching that she
brought the lambs into town
for sale. Several had asked
the price, but had turned away
without purchasing. After relating
to Paulina her story she
sat down, and putting her arm
around her lambs began to cry.
Paulina told her to dry her
tears, gave her the price of her
lambs, and then told her to take
them home, and let them still
be the commencement of her
mountain flock. The gratitude
expressed by the poor creature,
by both words and look at this
generous act of kindness, amply
repaid Paulina for the little
sacrifice she had made to
relieve her.</p>

<p>As Paulina grew larger, her
humanity exercised itself toward
other objects, and as her
heavenly Father had given her
the means of doing good, she
felt pure delight in being generous,
and receiving marks of
gratitude wherever she went.
She was loved by her neighbors,
rich as well as poor, and
was happy herself, because she
tried to make others so.</p>
